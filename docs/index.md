# Electric Hive - Bootcamp Student Application - 2022

## About the Bootcamp

This is an 8-week programming bootcamp that will teach new/novice programmers the fundamentals of programming. The course will be taught in Python and is based off the [University of Helsinki Python MOOC 2021](https://programming-21.mooc.fi/).

The course will follow a [flipped classroom](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/flipped-classrooms) format.

Each week, the students will be distributed information.

After that week

## About the application process

Fill out the student application form here: https://forms.gle/VWR8eNCuGGZuWQ5J6

### Who should apply

We are looking for students who are:

- new or novice programmers - this is a good fit if you have little to no experience with programming
- non-traditional students - this is probably not a good fit for students who have significant formal background
- able to commit ~8 hours to learning during the bootcamp

## Application Project

We are asking every applicant to complete a simple project in order to demonstrate willingness to put in work to learn, basic computer skills and the ability to self-teach.

In this project, you will:

1. Set up a basic programming environment
2. Use git to clone this code repository
3. Write a simple Python program
4. Use git to fork this repository
5. Add your program to a new branch in your forked repository
6. Create a pull request to merge your changes to the original repository

If you don't know how to do any of this: Don’t panic!

We will walk you through the steps.

If something’s not working, that’s perfectly normal. You’ll get used to it. Sometimes things don’t go according to plan, even when you are following precise instructions.

### 1. Set up a programming environment

#### Install git

What is git?
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-git-learn-git-version-control/

Do you have git installed on your computer?

On Windows, open the Command Line or PowerShell.
On Mac or Linux open Terminal.
Enter: git –version
If you get a result similar to the following you are good to go: git version 2.35.3

What if you don’t have git on your computer?

You will need to install it.
There’s a guide on the official Git website, that you can follow:
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

If you are on Windows there’s a mode detailed guide:
https://shalmonanandas.github.io/tutorials/2022/04/05/Git-+-Github-for-beginners.html
It includes the setup of Windows Terminal, which is also nice, so you can follow that as well.

For setting up a github repo you can follow the following guide from chapter 5:
https://shalmonanandas.github.io/tutorials/2022/04/05/Git-+-Github-for-beginners.html

Additional git resources that we recommend reading:

#### Install Python

What is Python:
https://opensource.com/resources/python

Do you have Python installed on your computer?

On Windows, open the Command Line or PowerShell.
On Mac or Linux open Terminal.
Enter: python3 –version
If you have 3.6 or higher, you are good to go

What should you do if you have lower than the required version, or you don’t have Python installed at all?

Follow the instructions on the following page:
https://realpython.com/installing-python/

Linux specific instructions:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-python-on-linux/
Windows specific instructions:
https://www.python.org/downloads/
https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-python-3-windows
Mac specific instructions:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

First, check if you have Python installed.

If you don't have Python installed, download the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install it.

Task 1:
Create a github repository called: hive_python_hello
Follow the file structure below:

    hello_world
        hello_world.py

Write a program, that after starting it in the Terminal, it asks the user for a name and then prints the following: Hello Name! (example image attached)

#### Install Visual Studio Code

###

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)

```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/electrichive/bootcamp-application-project-22/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

#### Write a simple Python program

Task 1:
Create a github repository called: hive_python_hello
Follow the file structure below:

    hello_world
        hello_world.py

Write a program, that after starting it in the Terminal, it asks the user for a name and then prints the following: Hello Name! (example image attached)

Push the file and the folder to the repository.
Share the repository with the Hive (email@email.com)

#### Create a pull request to merge your changes into the repository

Task 2:

Clone the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/electrichive/bootcamp-programming-22
Create a new branch
Add your name (github userName?) to the end of the list in **\_**.md
Push your changes to your branch
Create a Pull Request

Create a folder you will be using for the bootcamp. Let’s call it: Hive_Python_Bootcamp (or give any name you’d like).

Open your Terminal (or Git Bash) and navigate to that folder.
-> how to use the terminal basics articles here (navigate, create folder, create file commands)

Create a folder hello_world

Open that folder in your text editor of choice (code . command).

Initialize the folder as a git repository (how to do it python)

Create a file called hello_world.py

Write a program, that asks for the user’s name in the terminal and after the user entered their name, the terminal should write Hello user_name!

Push it to your repository and share the repository with the Hive GitHub account.
